Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that records changes to files overtime,allowing multiple contributors to colaborate without loosing previous work. 
Popular because it provides cloud based repositories and,colaboration tools
Version control helps maintainproject integrity by keeping track of changes,allowing rollbacks and preventing conflicts.
Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
1. Sign in to GitHub
2. Click on"New Repository."
3. Choose a name
4. Select visibility
5. Choose whether to initialize with a README
6. Click "Create repository".

Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
It provides an overview of the project, set up instructions, usage, guidelines,and contribution rules
It enhances collaborations
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
    Public repository- Accessible to anyone. It enhances collaboration but risks exposing sensitive code
    Private repository-It has restricted access. Useful for proprietary projects but limitsexternal contributions
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
steps  1. Clone a repository              Commits-Saves fil vesions, enabling rollback and tracking changes
        2.Create files
        3.Stage changes
        4.Commit changes
        5.Push to GitHub

How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
  Branching allows multiple development lines within a project
    i)Create a branch(git branch)
    2)Switch to the branch(git checkout)
    3)Develop and commit changes
    4)Merge back to main(git merge)
    5)Delete branch(git branch)

Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
  PR proposes changes before merging them into the main branch
  Steps:
    1.Push changes to a new branch
    2.Open aPR on GitHub
    3.Review and discuss the changes
    4.Approve and merge
  PR enhances collaboration by allowing discussion and review before merging
Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
  Forking creates an independent copy of a repository under user's account while cloning is local and doesn't create a separate GitHub repository
  Forking is useful for contributing to open-source project
Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
  Issues- Track bugs
  Project boards-Organize task using Kanban style boards

Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
1.Merge conflicts
2.Not using branches properly
3.Unclear commit messages
